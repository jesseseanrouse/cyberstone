				Iâ€™m a software engineer who uses my experience in education and
				retail to pay attention to detail when troubleshooting and thinking
				through code. When I code, I set up foundations with long term goals in
				mind and then fine tune once the basics are working. I wrote the front end of
				this app using React and I used firebase as my backend.
